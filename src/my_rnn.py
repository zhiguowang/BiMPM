  Similar to the unidirectional case above (rnn) but takes input and builds
  independent forward and backward RNNs. The input_size of forward and
  backward cell must match. The initial state for both directions is zero by
  default (but can be set optionally) and no intermediate states are ever
  returned -- the network is fully unrolled for the given (passed in)
  length(s) of the sequence(s) or completely unrolled if length(s) is not
  given.

  Args:
    cell_fw: An instance of RNNCell, to be used for forward direction.
    cell_bw: An instance of RNNCell, to be used for backward direction.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.
      If time_major == False (default), this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, input_size]`.
      If time_major == True, this must be a tensor of shape:
        `[max_time, batch_size, input_size]`.
      [batch_size, input_size].
    sequence_length: An int32/int64 vector, size `[batch_size]`,
      containing the actual lengths for each of the sequences.
    initial_state_fw: (optional) An initial state for the forward RNN.
      This must be a tensor of appropriate type and shape
      `[batch_size, cell_fw.state_size]`.
      If `cell_fw.state_size` is a tuple, this should be a tuple of
      tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in cell_fw.state_size`.
    initial_state_bw: (optional) Same as for `initial_state_fw`, but using
      the corresponding properties of `cell_bw`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial states and expected output.
      Required if initial_states are not provided or RNN states have a
      heterogeneous dtype.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
      but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs
      which would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
      performance penalty.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.
      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
      Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids
      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state.  Required if
      either of the initial states are not provided.
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "BiRNN"

  Returns:
    A tuple (outputs, output_states) where:
      outputs: A tuple (output_fw, output_bw) containing the forward and
        the backward rnn output `Tensor`.
        If time_major == False (default),
          output_fw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
          `[batch_size, max_time, cell_fw.output_size]`
          and output_bw will be a `Tensor` shaped:
          `[batch_size, max_time, cell_bw.output_size]`.

        It returns a tuple instead of a single concatenated `Tensor`, unlike
        in the `bidirectional_rnn`. If the concatenated one is preferred,
        the forward and backward outputs can be concatenated as
        `tf.concat(2, outputs)`.

  """Creates a recurrent neural network specified by RNNCell `cell`.

  This function is functionally identical to the function `rnn` above, but
  performs fully dynamic unrolling of `inputs`.

  Unlike `rnn`, the input `inputs` is not a Python list of `Tensors`, one for
  each frame.  Instead, `inputs` may be a single `Tensor` where
  the maximum time is either the first or second dimension (see the parameter
  `time_major`).  Alternatively, it may be a (possibly nested) tuple of
  Tensors, each of them having matching batch and time dimensions.
  The corresponding output is either a single `Tensor` having the same number
  of time steps and batch size, or a (possibly nested) tuple of such tensors,
  matching the nested structure of `cell.output_size`.

  The parameter `sequence_length` is optional and is used to copy-through state
  and zero-out outputs when past a batch element's sequence length. So it's more
  for correctness than performance, unlike in rnn().

  Args:
    cell: An instance of RNNCell.
    inputs: The RNN inputs.

      If `time_major == False` (default), this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
        `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such
        elements.

      If `time_major == True`, this must be a `Tensor` of shape:
        `[max_time, batch_size, ...]`, or a nested tuple of such
        elements.

      This may also be a (possibly nested) tuple of Tensors satisfying
      this property.  The first two dimensions must match across all the inputs,
      but otherwise the ranks and other shape components may differ.
      In this case, input to `cell` at each time-step will replicate the
      structure of these tuples, except for the time dimension (from which the
      time is taken).

      The input to `cell` at each time step will be a `Tensor` or (possibly
      nested) tuple of Tensors each with dimensions `[batch_size, ...]`.
    sequence_length: (optional) An int32/int64 vector sized `[batch_size]`.
    initial_state: (optional) An initial state for the RNN.
      If `cell.state_size` is an integer, this must be
      a `Tensor` of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.
      If `cell.state_size` is a tuple, this should be a tuple of
      tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in cell.state_size`.
    dtype: (optional) The data type for the initial state and expected output.
      Required if initial_state is not provided or RNN state has a heterogeneous
      dtype.
    parallel_iterations: (Default: 32).  The number of iterations to run in
      parallel.  Those operations which do not have any temporal dependency
      and can be run in parallel, will be.  This parameter trades off
      time for space.  Values >> 1 use more memory but take less time,
      while smaller values use less memory but computations take longer.
    swap_memory: Transparently swap the tensors produced in forward inference
      but needed for back prop from GPU to CPU.  This allows training RNNs
      which would typically not fit on a single GPU, with very minimal (or no)
      performance penalty.
    time_major: The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` Tensors.
      If true, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[max_time, batch_size, depth]`.
      If false, these `Tensors` must be shaped `[batch_size, max_time, depth]`.
      Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids
      transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation.  However,
      most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function
      accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "RNN".

  Returns:
    A pair (outputs, state) where:

      outputs: The RNN output `Tensor`.

        If time_major == False (default), this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
          `[batch_size, max_time, cell.output_size]`.

        If time_major == True, this will be a `Tensor` shaped:
          `[max_time, batch_size, cell.output_size]`.

        Note, if `cell.output_size` is a (possibly nested) tuple of integers
        or `TensorShape` objects, then `outputs` will be a tuple having the
        same structure as `cell.output_size`, containing Tensors having shapes
        corresponding to the shape data in `cell.output_size`.

      state: The final state.  If `cell.state_size` is an int, this
        will be shaped `[batch_size, cell.state_size]`.  If it is a
        `TensorShape`, this will be shaped `[batch_size] + cell.state_size`.
        If it is a (possibly nested) tuple of ints or `TensorShape`, this will
        be a tuple having the corresponding shapes.
